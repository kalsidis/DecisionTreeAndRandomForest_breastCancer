# DecisionTreeAndRandomForest_breastCancer
I use Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms in breast_cancer dataset to predict the target feauture. Also I made
some graphs where you can see the value of the metrices accuracy, recall, precision and f1 while the number of estimators 
in random forest was encreasing.
